# Amazon Clone
## In this project, Iâ€™ve created a clone of the Amazon shopping landing page using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the look and feel of the Amazon homepage, showcasing products, navigation, and other essential elements.

# Basic Structure
## The project folder contains the following files:
### index.html: The main HTML file for the landing page.
### style.css: The CSS file for styling the page.
### Images/: A directory containing images used in the project (e.g., product images, banners).
### README.md: This README file.

# Getting Started
## Clone this repository to your local machine.
## Open index.html in your web browser to view the Amazon landing page.
## Feel free to explore the code and customize it further to enhance your skills!
